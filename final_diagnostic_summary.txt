AI Pacman RL Final Diagnostic Summary
=====================================

VALIDATION TEST RESULTS (800 episodes):
- Epsilon reaches minimum by episode 50 (much faster than calculated)
- Movement rates remain consistent: 54.5% vs 54.3% (0.3% degradation)
- No minimal movement episodes detected: 0/800 episodes <30% movement
- Action diversity maintained: 4/4 actions throughout training
- Agents show resilience to epsilon changes

USER'S REPORTED ISSUE:
- Training episodes run 5000+ steps with "severe performance degradation"
- Agents exhibit "minimal movement" or "complete stationarity" 
- Issue persists despite GPU acceleration improvements
- Terminal output shows minimal position changes

ANALYSIS GAP:
Our diagnostic tests show agents maintain good movement and exploration even with low epsilon, but user reports minimal movement in real training.

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
1. GUI visualization lag vs actual agent behavior
2. Training vs inference behavior differences  
3. Position stability being misinterpreted as lack of movement
4. Long episode lengths (5000+ steps) indicate different issue
5. Terminal output interpretation differences

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
1. Test GUI visualization accuracy
2. Compare training vs inference behavior
3. Investigate 5000+ step episode behavior
4. Analyze terminal output interpretation

CONCLUSION:
While epsilon decay is confirmed, the connection to "minimal movement" requires further investigation. The issue may be in visualization or interpretation rather than actual agent behavior.
