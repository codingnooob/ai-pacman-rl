AI Pacman RL Diagnostic Results Summary
=======================================

Test Results (300 steps across 3 episodes):
- Movement Rate: 55.3% (166/300 steps involved movement)
- Penalty Pressure: 0.100 (below 0.3 threshold)
- Base Rewards: 1.381 (very positive)

HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION:
- High penalty pressure (>0.3): FALSE (0.100)
- Low movement rate (<30%): FALSE (55.3%)

CONCLUSION: Primary hypothesis REJECTED
The issue is NOT excessive reward penalties.

ALTERNATIVE ROOT CAUSES TO INVESTIGATE:
1. Terminal output interpretation - user may be misreading logs
2. Training vs inference behavior differences
3. Long-term training degradation (episodes 1000+)
4. Epsilon decay causing exploration loss over time
5. GUI visualization lag vs actual agent behavior
